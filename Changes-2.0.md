# 2.0 Changes

## Split queues

In haredo@1 You could start a queue based chain with both haredo.queue(...).exchange(...) and haredo.exchange(...).queue(...). This causes some ambiguity in the API though (eg. if You only use .exchange then the subscribe method is there, but using it throws a runtime error). To reduce the chances of misusing the library I've limited the user. Now, if You plan on binding a queue to an exhange You have to do haredo.queue(...).bindExchange(...)

## Classes

I've moved (mostly) away from classes to using closures to contain the state. Initially this was to allow for a better code reuse in the split chains but it also helps by enabling users to destructure methods.

## Subscribing changes

The signatures for subscribe callback and middleware were different and it always irked me. Now they're somewhat unified.
The wrapped message object is the first argument and it can be destructured to get data, routingKey, ack/nack/reply methods, etc.

```typescript
// haredo@1:
haredo.queue('test')
    .use(async (message, next) => {
        if (message.data.id === 2) {
            return message.ack();
        }
        await next();
        console.log('handled message successfully');
    })
    .subscribe((data, message) => {
        console.log(data.id);
        message.nack(false);
    });

// haredo@2:
haredo.queue('test')
    .use(async ({ data, ack }, next) => {
        if (message.data.id === 2) {
            return ack();
        }
        await next();
        console.log('handled message successfully');
    })
    .subscribe(({ data, nack }) => {
        console.log(data.id);
        await nack(false);
    });
```

### Failure backoff

I've removed the options .failThreshold, .failTimeout, .failSpan and replaced it with
.backoff(standardBackoff({...})). This allows users to write their own failure backoff
algorithms.
